### Composed Components

A `LinkButton` uses the following components.

<ComposedComponents components={["Text", "IconList", "Icon"]}/>

## Examples

### Variants
A link button can use different variants.

<Example src="buttons/docs/linkButton/variant" />

**Primary** - For the principal call to action on the page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen — not including the application header, modal or side panel.

**Secondary** - For secondary actions on each page. Secondary buttons can be used in conjunction with a primary link button or on its own. Paired with a Primary link button, the secondary link button usually performs the negative action of the set, such as “Cancel.”

**Upsell** - For upsell actions that relate to upgrading an account or a plan. Use the upsell link button to distinguish it from an existing primary link button. In some cases, a primary link button can be used instead when the general context of the page is about upselling.

**Danger** - For actions that could have destructive effects on the user’s data.

**Ghost-[primary|secondary|danger]** - For less prominent, and sometimes independent, actions. Ghost buttons can be used in isolation or paired with a primary link button when there are multiple calls to action. Ghost buttons can also be used for subtasks on a
page where a primary link button for the main and final action is present.

### Sizes
A link button can vary in size.

<Example src="buttons/docs/linkButton/size" />

### Disabled
A link button can be disabled.

<Example src="buttons/docs/linkButton/state" />

### External

Add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and `target="_blank"` attributes to render and external link button.

<Example src="buttons/docs/linkButton/external" />

### No Href

When a link button link does not have an href prop, it is rendered as a `<span role="link">` instead of an `<a>`. Events will need to be handled in JavaScript with the `onPress` prop.

Note: this will not behave like a native link. Browser features like context menus and open in a new tab will not apply.

<Example src="buttons/docs/linkButton/noHref" />

### Fluid
A link button can be expanded to full width to fill its parent container.

<Example src="buttons/docs/linkButton/layout" />

### Icon Only
A link button can contain only an icon.

<Example src="buttons/docs/linkButton/icon" />

### Icon
A link button can contain icons.

<Example src="buttons/docs/linkButton/icons" />

### End Icon
Nonstandard end icons can be provided to handle special cases. However, think twice before adding end icons, start icons should be your go-to.

<Example src="buttons/docs/linkButton/endIcon" />

<Example src="buttons/docs/linkButton/reactRouterLink" />

    ## Advanced customization

    ### Contexts

    All Hopper Components export a corresponding context that can be used to send props to them from a parent element.
    You can send any prop or ref via context that you could pass to the corresponding component.
    The local props and ref on the component are merged with the ones passed via context, with the local props taking precedence
