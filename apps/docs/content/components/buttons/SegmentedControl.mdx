## Usage

### Selected
A segmented control can have an item initially selected, by using `defaultSelectedKey` for uncontrolled or `selectedKey` for controlled.
Here's an example where one item is selected using defaultSelectedKey.

<Example src="SegmentedControl/docs/selected" />

### Size
A segmented control supports multiple sizes. Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating the medium size option:

<Example src="SegmentedControl/docs/size" />

### Icon only
Items within a segmented control can contain only icons. An accessible name must be provided through [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) prop. See also [WCAG practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA6.html).

<Example src="SegmentedControl/docs/iconOnly" />

### Icon
A segmented control can contain items with icons, starting or ending.
**Non standard** starting icons can be provided to handle special cases. However, think twice before adding start icons, end icons should be your go to.

<Example src="SegmentedControl/docs/icon" />

### Justified
A segmented control can have items with similar widths.

<Example src="SegmentedControl/docs/justified" />

### Controlled
A segmented control can have a controlled selected value. In this example, it shows how it is possible to select an option.
