## Anatomy

### Composed Components

A `Button` uses the following components:

<ComposedComponents components={["Icon", "IconList", "Text"] }/>

## Usage

### Variants
A button can use different variants.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/variant" />

**Primary** - For the principal call to action on the page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen — not including the application header, modal or side panel.

**Secondary** - For secondary actions on each page. Secondary buttons can be used in conjunction with a primary button or on its own. Paired with a Primary button, the secondary button usually performs the negative action of the set, such as “Cancel.”

**Upsell** - For upsell actions that relate to upgrading an account or a plan. Use the upsell button to distinguish it from an existing primary button. In some cases, a primary button can be used instead when the general context of the page is about upselling.

**Danger** - For actions that could have destructive effects on the user’s data.

**Ghost-[primary|secondary|danger]** - For less prominent, and sometimes independent, actions. Ghost buttons can be used in isolation or paired with a primary button when there are multiple calls to action. Ghost buttons can also be used for subtasks on a
page where a primary button for the main and final action is present.

### Sizes
A button can vary in size.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/size" />

### Disabled
A button can be disabled.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/state" />

### Loading
A button can show a loading indicator. The button text is hidden but the button maintains the width that it would have if the text were visible.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/loading" />

### Fluid
A button can be expanded to full width to fill its parent container.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/layout" />

### Icon Only
A button can contain only an icon. An accessible name must be provided through [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) prop. See also [WCAG practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA6.html).

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/icon" />

### Icon
A button can contain icons.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/icons" />

### End Icon
Nonstandard end icons can be provided to handle special cases. However, think twice before adding end icons, start icons should be your go-to.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/endIcon" />

    ## Advanced customization

    ### Contexts

    All Hopper Components export a corresponding context that can be used to send props to them from a parent element.
    You can send any prop or ref via context that you could pass to the corresponding component.
    The local props and ref on the component are merged with the ones passed via context, with the local props taking precedence
