### Composed Components

A `Modal` uses the following components:

<ComposedComponents components={["Image", "Heading", "Header", "Content", "Footer", "Button", "ButtonGroup"]}/>

## Usage

### Default

A modal must have an heading and a content.

<Example src="Modal/docs/default" />

### Image

A modal can have a side banner image. Make sure the image has no essential information as it could be cropped in mobile view. Images should not prevent a user from seeing the close button, be conscious of this.

<Example src="Modal/docs/image" />

### Choice

A modal can offer a choice between 2 options. Keep the copy not too long in order to help the user quickly make his choice.

<Example src="Modal/docs/choice" />

### Header

Use an header to provide additional information usually in the form of a link or a tooltip that provides more context to the task at hand. Links should open in a new window.

<Example src="Modal/docs/header" />

### Footer

Use a footer to provide trivial information about content present in the modal, like a step : 1/3.

<Example src="Modal/docs/footer" />

### Buttons

A modal can have a single button. Use a primary button to provide the main action.

<Example src="Modal/docs/button" />

Or a group of button. A maximum of 3 buttons are allowed in a modal, when necessary. The secondary and tertiary actions should be using a secondary variant.

<Example src="Modal/docs/button-group" />

### Dismissable

By default, a modal will dismiss on outside interactions and esc keydown. However, in some cases, you might want to force the user to explicitly dismiss the modal with a targeted call to action.
This is what the `isDismissable` and the `isKeyboardDismissDisabled` prop is for.

You can set the isDismissable prop to false and isKeyboardDismissDisabled to true and render a call to action which will manually dismiss the popover by calling a close function.

<Example src="Modal/docs/dismissable" />

### Controlled

The open state can be handled in controlled mode.

<Example src="Modal/docs/controlled" />

### Custom trigger

You don't have to use a ModalTrigger component if it doesn't fit your needs. A modal component can be used on it's own with any custom trigger.

<Example src="Modal/docs/custom-trigger" />

### Sizes

A modal can be small, medium, large, extra-large, fullscreen or fullscreenTakeover. The default size is medium.

<Example src="Modal/docs/sizes" />

### Responsive sizes

A modal can have different size in mobile and desktop view.

<Example src="Modal/docs/responsive-sizes" />

### Custom

A CustomModal is a Modal with a custom layout.

<Example src="Modal/docs/custom" />
