### Composed Components

A `Link` uses the following components.

- [Icon](./Icon)
- [Text](./Text)

## Examples

### Disabled

Links can be disabled.

<Example src="Link/docs/disabled" />

### External

An external text link will render by default with `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and `target="_blank"` attributes.

<Example src="Link/docs/external" />

### No Href

When a `<Link>` does not have an href prop, it is rendered as a `<span role="link">` instead of an `<a>`. Events will need to be handled in JavaScript with the `onPress` prop.

Note: this will not behave like a native link. Browser features like context menus and open in a new tab will not apply.

<Example src="Link/docs/noHref" />

### Variants

Links can be presented in different variants.

<Example src="Link/docs/variants" />

### Sizes

Links can be presented in different sizes.

<Example src="Link/docs/size" />

### Inherit Size

The size can also be inherited.

<Example src="Link/docs/inheritSize" />

### Icon

Links can contain an icon.

<Example src="Link/docs/icon" />

### Start Icon

**Non standard** start icons can be provided to handle special cases. However, think twice before adding start icons, end icons should be your go to.

<Example src="Link/docs/startIcon" />

### Icon Only

A link's content can be a single icon. When using this variant, an accessible name must be provided through the `aria-label` prop. See [WCAG practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA6.html).

<Example src="Link/docs/iconOnly" />

### Quiet

All links can have a quiet style, without an underline. This style should only be used when the placement and context of the link is explicit enough that a visible underline isn’t necessary.

<Example src="Link/docs/quiet" />

### React Router Link

A button can be rendered as a react router link when using the `href` property and setting the navigate property on the `HopperProvider`

<Example src="Link/docs/reactRouterLink" />

### Custom Styles

When the colors from the variant props are not enough, you can use the `color` prop to set the color of the link. This removes the hover and focus colors from the link. Use the color props when a link needs to be placed on top of a colored background or visual. Make sure that the background and the link color meet the minimum color contrast ratio.

<Example src="Link/docs/staticColor" />

### Image

A link's content can be an image element.

<Example src="Link/docs/image" />
