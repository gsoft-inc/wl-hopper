### Composed Components

A `Disclosure` uses the following components.

<ComposedComponents components={["Text, Icon"]}/>

## Usage

### Disabled

A disclosure can be disabled.

<Example src="Disclosure/docs/disabled" />

### Variants

A disclosure has multiple variants.

<Example src="Disclosure/docs/variants" />

**Standalone** - Used when the disclosure is not inside a container.

**Inline** - Used when placing a disclosure inside a container.

### Icon

A disclosure can contain an icon.

<Example src="Disclosure/docs/icon" />

### Description

A disclosure can contain a description.

<Example src="Disclosure/docs/description" />

### Controlled

A disclosure can handle its expanded state in controlled mode.

<Example src="Disclosure/docs/controlled" />

### Custom Header

A disclosure can have a custom header. To accomplish this, do not use `DisclosureHeader` and use the [Button](./Button) component with `slot="trigger"` instead.
Using React Aria's [Button](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html) component will also work.

<Example src="Disclosure/docs/customHeader" />

## Progressive Enhancement

Our Disclosure component uses experimental CSS features like:

- **interpolate-size: allow-keywords;**: Enables fluid transitions between dynamic sizes.

- **transition-behavior: allow-discrete;**: Allows transitions for properties like content-visibility.

These features enhance animations where supported. In browsers without support, the component remains fully usable without animations, maintaining progressive enhancement.
