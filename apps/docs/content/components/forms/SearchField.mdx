### Composed Components

A `SearchField` uses the following components.

- [Label](./Label)
- [Helper Message](./HelperMessage)
- [Error Message](./ErrorMessage)

## Examples

### Disabled
A search field in a disabled state shows that an input field exists, but is not available in that circumstance. This can be used to maintain layout continuity and communicate that a field may become available later.

<Example src="inputs/docs/searchField/disabled" />

### ReadOnly
The `isReadOnly` prop makes the SearchField's text content immutable. Unlike `isDisabled`, the SearchField remains focusable and the contents can still be copied. See [the MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly) for more information.

<Example src="inputs/docs/searchField/readOnly" />

### Error
A SearchField can be displayed in an error state to indicate that the user input is invalid.

<Example src="inputs/docs/searchField/error" />

### Hide Clear Button
A search field can hide its clear button.

<Example src="inputs/docs/searchField/hideClearButton" />

### Sizes
Search fields have multiple sizes to choose from.

<Example src="inputs/docs/searchField/sizes" />

### Labeling
If a visible label isn't specified, an aria-label must be provided to the SearchField for accessibility. If the field is labeled by a separate element, an aria-labelledby prop must be provided using the ID of the labeling element instead.

<Example src="inputs/docs/searchField/labeling" />

### Description
A search field with a helper message.
