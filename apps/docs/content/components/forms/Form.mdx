### Composed Components

A `Form` uses the following components.

<ComposedComponents components={["Button", "ButtonGroup", "ErrorMessage", "HelperMessage", "NumberField", "PasswordField", "TextField"]}/>

## Examples

### Disabled

A disabled form will not allow the user to interact with the form.

<Example src="Form/docs/disabled" />

### Validation

To provide validation errors, the `validationErrors` prop should be set to an object that maps each field's `name` prop
to a string or array of strings representing one or more errors. These are displayed to the user as soon as the
`validationErrors` prop is set and cleared after the user modifies each field's value.

<Example src="Form/docs/validation" />

#### Native Behavior

Native HTML form validation is used to display errors and block form submission.

<Example src="Form/docs/nativeValidation" />

#### Aria Behavior

To use form validation via ARIA, set the `validationBehavior` property to "aria".
This will not block form submission and will display validation errors to the user in real time as the value is modified.

<Example src="Form/docs/ariaValidation" />

### Sizes

A form has multiple sizes to choose from.

<Example src="Form/docs/size" />

### Fluid

Form fields can take the width of their container.
