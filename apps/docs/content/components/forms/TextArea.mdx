## Usage

### Disabled
A text area in a disabled state shows that an input field exists, but is not available in that circumstance. This can be used to maintain layout continuity and communicate that a field may become available later.

<Example src="inputs/docs/textArea/disabled" />

### ReadOnly
The `isReadOnly` prop makes the text area's text content immutable. Unlike `isDisabled`, the text area remains focusable and the contents can still be copied. See [the MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly) for more information.

<Example src="inputs/docs/textArea/readOnly" />

### Error
A text area can be displayed in an error state to indicate that the user input is invalid.

<Example src="inputs/docs/textArea/error" />

### Sizes
A text area can vary in size. The height is determined by the number of rows. Each size has a unique font size, resulting in varying heights across different sizes.

<Example src="inputs/docs/textArea/sizes" />

### Labeling
If a visible label isn't specified, an `aria-label` must be provided to the text area for accessibility. If the field is labeled by a separate element, an `aria-labelledby` prop must be provided using the ID of the labeling element instead.

<Example src="inputs/docs/textArea/labeling" />

### Description
A text area can have a description using the [HelperMessage](HelperMessage) component to provide additional context to the user.

<Example src="inputs/docs/textArea/description" />

### Character Count
A character count can be displayed below the input. The character count is based on the `maxLength` prop. If the `maxLength` prop is not set, the character count will not be displayed.

<Example src="inputs/docs/textArea/characterCount" />

### Max Length Exceeded
To exceed the max length, set the `allowExceedingMaxLength` prop to `true` – default is `false`. When the character count is displayed, it turns red if the max length is exceeded.

Note: If allowExceedingMaxLength is set, a character count is required to be set as well.

<Example src="inputs/docs/textArea/maxLengthExceeded" />

### Rows
The `rows` prop can be used to set the height of the text area and should be used in favor of the `height` prop. One row is equivalent to the height of one line of text.

<Example src="inputs/docs/textArea/rows" />

### Max Rows
The `maxRows` prop can be used to set the maximum height of the text area and should be used in favor of the `maxHeight` prop.
It differs from the `rows` prop in that it will not set the initial height of the text area.

<Example src="inputs/docs/textArea/maxRows" />

### Vertical Resize
The `resizeMode` prop can be used to set the resize behavior of the text area.
The default behavior is `none`, which prevents the user from resizing the text area.
The `vertical` behavior allows the user to resize the text area vertically.

<Example src="inputs/docs/textArea/verticalResize" />
