    ## Advanced customization

    ### Contexts

    All Hopper Components export a corresponding context that can be used to send props to them from a parent element.
    You can send any prop or ref via context that you could pass to the corresponding component.
    The local props and ref on the component are merged with the ones passed via context, with the local props taking precedence
