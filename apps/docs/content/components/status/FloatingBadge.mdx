## Usage

### Placement

A floating badge can be positioned relative to another component using the `placement` prop. This allows the badge to be placed in any of the 4 positions around the target component.

<Example src="Badge/docs/floatingbadge/placement" />

### Overlap

Allows you to specify whether the badge overlaps a rectangular or circular component.

<Example src="Badge/docs/floatingbadge/overlap" />

### Offset

The position of the badge can be adjusted using the `offset` prop. This prop accepts an object with `x` and `y` properties that will be used to adjust the badge's position.
