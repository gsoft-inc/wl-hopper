### Composed Components

A `Callout` uses the following components:

<ComposedComponents components={["Header", "Content", "Button", "RichIcon"]} />
<br />

A `CompactCallout` uses the following components:

<ComposedComponents components={["Content", "Button", "Link"]} />

## Usage

### Variants
A callout can use different variants.

<Example src="Callout/docs/variant" />

### Hide Icon
A callout can hide the icon in scenarios where it takes up too much space, such as very small breakpoints.

<Example src="Callout/docs/noIcon" />

### Custom Icon
A callout can have a custom rich icon.

<Example src="Callout/docs/customIcon" />

### Dismissable
A callout is only dismissable when `onClose` prop is set.

Here's an example without `onClose`.

<Example src="Callout/docs/notDismissable" />

### Inline callout
Within a container, a callout shouldn't have borders. Here's an example of a callout inside a Card.

<Example src="Callout/docs/inline" />

### Compact callout
A more streamlined version of the Callout component that is designed to be used in more compact spaces.

<Example src="Callout/docs/compact" />

### Compact callout variants
A compact callout can have the same variants.

<Example src="Callout/docs/compactVariant" />

### Compact callout CTAs
A compact callout can have either a button or a link as CTA. Here's an example where it's a link.

<Example src="Callout/docs/compactLink" />

### Dismissable compact callout
Similar to the Callout, the dismiss icon appears only when `onClose` is set.

<Example src="Callout/docs/dismissableCompact" />

## Props

### Callout

<PropTable component="Callout" />

### CompactCallout
