## Examples

### Sizes
You can alter the size of the text by specifying a `size` prop.
The available sizes match the Hopper Typography Type Scale - a type scale is a set of [font-size and line-height](https://hopper.workleap.design/tokens/semantic/typography#tokens-body) pairs.

<Example src="typography/Text/docs/text/size" />

### Inherit
You can also alter the size to match the parent element's type scale by using the `inherit` size.

<Example src="typography/Text/docs/text/inherit" />

### Nested
The Text component can be nested within other Text components and inherit the parent's size by default.

<Example src="typography/Text/docs/text/nested" />

    ## Advanced customization

    ### Contexts
    All Hopper Components export a corresponding context that can be used to send props to them from a parent element.
    You can send any prop or ref via context that you could pass to the corresponding component.
    The local props and ref on the component are merged with the ones passed via context, with the local props taking precedence.
