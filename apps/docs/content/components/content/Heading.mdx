## Examples

### Sizes
You can alter the size of the heading by specifying a `size` prop.
The available sizes match Hopper Typography Type Scale — a type scale is a set of [font-size and line-height](https://hopper.workleap.design/tokens/semantic/typography#tokens-heading) pairs.

<Example src="typography/Heading/docs/sizes" />

### Levels
You can alter the level of the heading by specifying a `level` prop.
The available levels match HTML heading elements — h1-h6.

<Example src="typography/Heading/docs/levels" />

### Inherit
You can alter the size of a heading to match the parent element's type scale by using the `inherit` size.

    ## Advanced customization

    ### Contexts

    All Hopper Components export a corresponding context that can be used to send props to them from a parent element.
    You can send any prop or ref via context that you could pass to the corresponding component.
    The local props and ref on the component are merged with the ones passed via context, with the local props taking precedence
