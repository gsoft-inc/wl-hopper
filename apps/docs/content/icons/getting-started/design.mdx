# Design

In order to assure constitency across the Workleap platform, creating icons should follow the guidelines below.

## Contribution Guidelines

New icons are often needed as we create new experiences with Workleap. The following guide will help you contribute to the Workleap icon library.

### Process

Before proposing a new icon, look through the current icon set to see if an existing icon could fit your needs or that the concept in your mind doesn’t already exist.

All designers are encouraged to design their own icons and should do so. One question that you must ask yourself before creating a new icon is whether the new concept to be designed is vertical-specific or could benefit all verticals of Workleap. That being said, all rich icons/spot icons are always vertical-specific.

## Designing icons

## Design Guide

The Workleap icon library has a set and specific design language. It’s important to follow this design language when contributing a new icon to ensure a common understanding across all verticals and make any new addition feel at home in Workleap.

## Anatomy

### Definitions

#### Frame Size

The frame size is the size of the artboard that the icon is designed in.

#### Stroke Alignment

The stroke alignment is the position of the stroke in relation to the shape. The stroke can be aligned to the inside, center, or outside of the shape.

You should use center except if the shape is closed. In that case use inside.

#### Corner Radius

Use the radius in the table unless using a different radius makes the icon more legible.

#### Terminal

The terminal is the end of a stroke. The terminal can be round, square, or flat.

#### Inner spacing

The inner spacing is the space between the shape and the stroke.

#### Fill

The fill is the color of the shape. Icons using a fill are also known as solid icons. Any shapes on a filled icon should follow the stroke guidelines.

#### Keylines

Keylines are the lines that define the shape of the icon. They are used to define the shape of the icon and the stroke alignment. You can toggle them in Figma by pressing `⌘G`(Mac) or `Ctrl+G`(PC).
