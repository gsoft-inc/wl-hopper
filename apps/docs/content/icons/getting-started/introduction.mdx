# Introduction

Hopper provides a set of commonly used interface icons you can use in your project.

These icons are published into a separate package that is not part of `@hopper-ui/components` by default.

Hopper provides multiple ways to use icons in your project:
- [as React components](/icons/react-icons/installation)
- [as static SVG files](/icons/svg/installation)
