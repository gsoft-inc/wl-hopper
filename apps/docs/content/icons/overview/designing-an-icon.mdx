To maintain visual consistency across the Workleap platform, icon creators should follow these guidelines when contributing to the Workleap icon library.
**All designers are encouraged to create their own icons.** Use the design language and specifications outlined in this guide to ensure alignment across all Workleap products.

## Before You Begin

**1. Review Existing Icons:**
Before proposing a new icon, explore the current icon set to determine if an existing design fits your needs. Avoid duplicating concepts and ensure your proposal adds unique value.

**2. Understand the Design Language:**
The Workleap icon library follows a specific and consistent design language. Adhering to this language is crucial for maintaining a shared understanding across all verticals and ensuring new additions feel cohesive within Workleap's visual system.

## Anatomy of an Icon

Icons in the Workleap library have several defined characteristics. Understanding these attributes is essential for creating high-quality contributions.

### Definitions

- Frame Size - The dimensions of the artboard in which the icon is designed.
- Stroke Alignment - The stroke's position relative to the shape. Use **center** alignment unless the shape is closed; in that case, use **inside**.
- Corner Radius - Follow the standard radius values from the design specification table. Deviations are allowed only to improve legibility.
- Terminal - The end style of a stroke, which can be round, square, or flat.
- Inner spacing - The space between a shape and its stroke.
- Fill - The shape's color. Icons using a fill are also known as solid icons. Any shapes on a filled icon should follow the stroke guidelines.
- Keylines - Lines that define an icon's shape and stroke alignment. In Figma, toggle them using `âŒ˜G`(Mac) or `Ctrl+G`(PC).

### Values
