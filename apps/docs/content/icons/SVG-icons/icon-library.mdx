All icons in the Workleap icon library are available in three predefined sizes. To ensure consistency and clarity, always use the icons at one of these sizes. Avoid resizing icons to dimensions other than the provided options.

To integrate an icon into your project, simply import it from `@hopper-ui/svg-icons` in a JavaScript file:

```tsx
import AlertIcon from "@hopper-ui/svg-icons/alert-24.svg";
```
or in a CSS file:
```css
.my-component {
    background-image: url("@hopper-ui/svg-icons/alert-24.svg");
}
```

You can preview icons in your preferred size. Simply click on an icon to instantly copy its name!
