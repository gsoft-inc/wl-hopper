All icons in the Workleap icon library are available in three predefined sizes. To ensure consistency and clarity, always use the icons at one of these sizes. Avoid resizing icons to dimensions other than the provided options.

To integrate an icon into your project, simply import it from `@hopper-ui/svg-icons` in a JavaScript file:

```tsx
import AlertIcon from "@hopper-ui/svg-icons/icons/alert-24.svg";
```
or in a CSS file:
```css
.my-component {
    background-image: url("@hopper-ui/svg-icons/icons/alert-24.svg");
}
```

## Inline SVG

Hopper's SVG icons are designed to be used as inline SVGs. This allows you to easily customize the icon's color, size, and other properties using CSS.
```tsx
// a specific size
import { AlertIcon32 } from "@hopper-ui/svg-icons/icons/inline";
// or an object containing all the sizes
import { AlertIcon }  from "@hopper-ui/svg-icons/icons/inline";
```



You can preview icons in your preferred size. Simply click on an icon to instantly copy it's `.svg` name!
