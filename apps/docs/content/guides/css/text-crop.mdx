# Text Crop

Every web font includes whitespace above and below the text, while useful in some instances, it can be a problem when vertically centering text or aligning text with other elements. This problem arise when a font has uneven whitespace. This is especially true when using a typeface with a large x-height, like *ABC Favorit*.

One way to compensate for this is to use a negative margin on the top and bottom of the text. This will crop the whitespace and make the text appear more centered, while preserving the line-height of the text.

## Implementation

It is suggested to apply this technique on a text element, such as a `span`, rather than on it's container, such as a `button` element.

Using a negative margin on the top and bottom of the text will crop the whitespace while preserving line height between lines in a multi-line block of text.

If you need to implement this technique, you can use the following CSS. Keep in mind that each font weight and line-height combinations have their own set of values. You need to use the right token for the job, these are documented in the [tokens section](http://localhost:3000/tokens/semantic/typography).

```tsx title="component.tsx"
<div className="myBadge">
    <span className="off-centered-text">NEW</span>
</div>
```

```css title="component.css"
.off-centered-text {
  font-family: 'ABC Favorit Mono', sans-serif;
}

.off-centenred-text::before,
.off-centered-text::after {
    content: '';
    display: block;
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
}

.off-centered-text::before {
    /* -0.125rem */
    margin-bottom: var(--hop-overline-bottom-offset);
}

.off-centered-text::after {
    /* -0.25rem */
    margin-top: var(--hop-overline-top-offset);
}
```

Feel free to inspect the above examples to see how the solution is applied in different contexts.

<div className="hd-sample hd-sample-text-offset">
    <div className="hd-sample__wrapper">
        <div className="myBadge"><span className="hd-sample-off-centered-text fixed">New</span></div>
        <div className="myHeadline"><span className="hd-sample-off-centered-text fixed">Bring out the best in your team</span></div>
    </div>
</div>
