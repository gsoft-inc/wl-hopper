import tokens from '../../../datas/tokens.json';

Motion brings meaning and a sense of life to the experience. It should be purposeful, intuitive, and seamless. Our motion utilities consists of two set of values, *durations* and *easings*.

## Usage

Both variables can be combined in [transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions) as well in [CSS animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations) to set the tone of an animation/transition (animation is used interchangeably with transition from now on).

In a transition declaration:

```css
.tease {
    transition: color var(--hop-easing-duration-1) var(--hop-easing-focus);
}
```

In an animation declaration:

```css
@keyframes tease-animation  {
    0% {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: scale(1.2);
    }
    100% {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: scale(1);
    }
}

.tease {
    animation: tease-animation var(--hop-easing-duration-2) var(--hop-easing-productive);
}
```

## Tokens

### Duration

Hopper exposes 5 durations, they help convey a message and makes animations smooth and responsive.

<TokenTable category={"duration"} data={tokens.core["duration"]} noPreview />

### Easings

[Easings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function) denotes a mathematical function that describes the rate at which a numerical value changes.They add life to motion by providing natural rests and setting the mood of an animation. Hopper provides 3 predefined easings, each having their use.

#### Productive

Used in animations that are not in the way, they quickly change from one state to another.

#### Focus

Used in animations that are designed to draw the userâ€™s attention on what changed, in order to let them move on with their next task.

#### Expressive

Used in animations that are meant to give a sense of completeness or resolution to the user. Use them sparsely.

<TokenTable category={"timingFunction"} data={tokens.core["timingFunction"]} noPreview />

### Playground

<MotionPreview durations={tokens.core["duration"]} easings={tokens.core["timingFunction"]} noPreview />
