# Typography

Typography tokens are composite tokens, meaning they are made up of multiple other tokens. This allows us to create a consistent typographic scale across our products.

## Heading

Headings are used to create a hierarchy of content. They are used to help users scan and understand the content on a page.

<TypographyTable type="heading" data={tokens.semantic} />

## Overline

Used to introduce a headline.

<TypographyTable type="overline" data={tokens.semantic} />

## Body

Body text is used to communicate the main content of a page.

<TypographyTable type="body" data={tokens.semantic} />

## Accent

Accent text is used to highlight important information on a page.

<TypographyTable type="accent" data={tokens.semantic} />
