# Typography

Typography tokens are composite tokens, meaning they are made up of multiple other tokens. This allows us to create a consistent typographic scale across our products.

## Guidelines

### Working with typography

#### Use the bounding box to align with grid

The bounding box is the vertical height of the text and is defined by the line height. That value of the line height is critical to make sure text is aligned to the 8px grid of the interface.

### Line length should be between 40 to 60 characters.

Lines of text that are too short make the eyes strain while long lines make it hard to concentrate. As a way to give users the best reading experience, aim for lines of text between 40 to 60 characters, including spaces. If your text doesnâ€™t fit this rule, review the content length, font size or even information hierarchy.

### Align text using baseline

When aligning different text boxes together horizontally, use their baselines as a guide instead of their true center for a more harmonious look.

## Heading

Headings are used to create a hierarchy of content. They are used to help users scan and understand the content on a page.

<TypographyTable type="heading" data={tokens.semantic} />

## Overline

Used to introduce a headline.

_Adding a text-transform of uppercase is necessary in order to render overline as intended by the Design._

<TypographyTable type="overline" data={tokens.semantic} />

## Body

Body text is used to communicate the main content of a page.

<TypographyTable type="body" data={tokens.semantic} />

## Accent

Accent text is used to highlight important information on a page.

<TypographyTable type="accent" data={tokens.semantic} />
