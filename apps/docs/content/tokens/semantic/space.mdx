## Guidelines

### Working with spaces

Space is the distance between two objects in your design. It should be used to complement the purpose of a page, by creating hierarchy and helping the content become more useful and understandable.

### Be harmonious

Use Hopper DS space tokens in a way that is consistent with the rest of the experience. Some spaces are used in specific context, so be sure to follow the proper documentation to apply space at the right places.

### Create visual groups

The more visual elements are related, the closer they should be to each other.

export const categoryKey = "size";

## Tokens

### Padding

Padding refers to the space within a block or container from which elements are separated from the edge.

#### Inset

Inset space refers to the space within a block or container from which elements are separated from the edge. By default, the inset is equal on all four sides. Inset is also known as padding.

<TableSection categoryKey={categoryKey} tokens={tokens.semantic[categoryKey]} categories={
    ["inset"]
} excludedCategories={["inset-squish", "inset-stretch"]} />

#### Inset Squish

Squish inset reduces the top and bottom padding by one space increment relative to the default inset space.

<TableSection categoryKey={categoryKey} tokens={tokens.semantic[categoryKey]} categories={
    ["inset-squish"]
} />

#### Inset Stretch

Stretch inset increases the top and bottom padding by one space increment relative to the default inset space.

<TableSection categoryKey={categoryKey} tokens={tokens.semantic[categoryKey]} categories={
    ["inset-stretch"]
} />

### Margin

Margin refers to the traditional meaning of space between elements. It can be used as a margin or gap when in grid or flex layouts.

#### Stack

Stack is the space that separates elements or containers arranged vertically within a column. The last element of the stack should omit this space.

<TableSection categoryKey={categoryKey} tokens={tokens.semantic[categoryKey]} categories={
    ["stack"]
} />

#### Inline

Inline refers to the space that separates inline elements arranged horizontally and that may wrap on the right. The last element should omit this space.

<TableSection categoryKey={categoryKey} tokens={tokens.semantic[categoryKey]} categories={
    ["inline"]
} />
