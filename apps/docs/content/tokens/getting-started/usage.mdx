# Usage

## CSS Variables

### Tokens

Import the tokens in your project by doing the following:

```css title="myfile.css"
@import "@hopper-ui/tokens/tokens.css";
```

If your application supports a dark mode, import dark mode tokens as well:

```css title="myfile.css"
@import "@hopper-ui/tokens/dark/tokens.css";
```

You can now use the tokens in your project by using the following syntax:

```css title="myfile.css"
.my-class {
  background-color: var(--hop-primary-surface-weak);
}
```

### Fonts

In order to use Hopper fonts in your project, import the following:

```css title="myfile.css"
@import '@hopper-ui/tokens/fonts.css';
```

Font-face declarations are now imported in your project.

Failing to do so would prevent you from using font family tokens such as `var(--hop-font-family-primary)`.

## Styled System

We will be releasing a styled system package inspired by styled-components that will allow you to use these tokens as Javascript props at a later time.
