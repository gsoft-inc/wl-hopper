## Definitions

**Core tokens** are referring to raw values such as an hexadecimal color code, a border-width, a font-size. Think of them as paint name, Chocolate Frost is easier to use in a conversation than the exact color recipe.

**Semantic tokens** adds the intention layer to tokens, they map to a core token, or tokens should we say as the semantic tier has a notion of themability. Using our Chocolate Frost paint color example this would dictate where the paint color should be used, on dry walls or plastic, inside or outside.

**Component tokens** refers to the nuts and bolts of the components and their implementation details.  They are tied to their component. In our paint color example, this would be where a specific color is actually used, in which room and on which architectural part of it(ceiling, doors, wall).
