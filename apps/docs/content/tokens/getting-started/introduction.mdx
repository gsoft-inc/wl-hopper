# Introduction

At the heart of Workleap Design language are tokens, which drive its functionality. They are the key ingredients to everything UI. Workleap brand is dissected into design tokens, they live in the Hopper Design System.

A design token can store any of the following elements:

- A single value such as a color, a font-size, a border-width.
- A collection of indivisible values such as a box-shadow.

## Definitions

Hopper aims to provide a three tier token system, each tiers have their specific purposes.

### Core tokens

These tokens are referring to raw values such as an hexadecimal color code, a border-width, a font-size. They are the building blocks of the design system.

<Table category="color" data={[{
    "name": "hop-sapphire-200",
    "value": "#95b1ff"
}]} />

### Semantic tokens

Adds the intention layer to tokens, they map to a core token, or tokens should we say as the semantic tier has a notion of themability. They are the tokens that are used in the components.

<Table category="color" data={[{
    "name": "hop-primary-surface-disabled",
    "value": "#95b1ff"
}]} />

#### Dark

<Table category="color" data={[{
    "name": "hop-primary-surface-disabled",
    "value": "#2040c7"
}]} />

### Component tokens

Refers to the nuts and bolts of the components and their implementation details, they are the tokens exposed by components. They are tied to their respective component.

#### Light

<Table category="color" data={[{
    "name": "hop-button-primary-disabled",
    "value": "#95b1ff"
}]} />

#### Dark

<Table category="color" data={[{
    "name": "hop-button-primary-disabled",
    "value": "#2040c7"
}]} />

## When to use

### For Developers

Tokens should be used whenever Hopper components does not suit your current use case or if you can't use Hopper React components. They are also useful for situations where using a component does not make sense, such as adding a color for a background.

It should be noted that if your current stack prevents you to directly use Hopper components it is recommended to use components tokens in priorty as they are mapped 1:1 with Hopper implementation.

### For Designers

While developing features for Workleap, you might need to create new components or add new features to existing ones. In this case, you should use semantic tokens to create your components. This will ensure that your components are consistent with the rest of the design system. Only semantic tokens are available in Figma.
