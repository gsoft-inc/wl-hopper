description: A technique to crop the whitespace above and below text to make it appear more centered.

Every web font includes whitespace above and below the text, while useful in some instances, it can be a problem when vertically centering text or aligning text with other elements. This problem arises when a font has uneven whitespace. This is especially true when using a typeface with a large x-height, like *ABC Favorit*.

One way to compensate for this is to use a negative margin on the top and bottom of the text. This will crop the whitespace and make the text appear more centered, while preserving the line-height of the text.

## Implementation

It is suggested to apply this technique on a text element, such as a `span`, rather than on it's container, such as a `button` element.

Using a negative margin on the top and bottom of the text will crop the whitespace while preserving line height between lines in a multi-line block of text.

If you need to implement this technique, you can use the following CSS. Keep in mind that each font weight and line-height combinations have their own set of values. You need to use the right token for the job, these are documented in the [tokens section](/tokens/semantic/typography).

```tsx title="component.tsx"
<div className="myBadge">
    <span className="off-centered-text">NEW</span>
</div>
```

```css title="component.css"
.off-centered-text {
    font-family: 'ABC Favorit Mono', sans-serif;
}

.off-centenred-text::before,
.off-centered-text::after {
    content: '';
    display: block;
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
}

.off-centered-text::before {
    /* -0.125rem */
    margin-bottom: var(--hop-overline-bottom-offset);
}

.off-centered-text::after {
    /* -0.25rem */
    margin-top: var(--hop-overline-top-offset);
}
```

Feel free to inspect the above examples to see how the solution is applied in different contexts.

<div className="hd-sample hd-sample-text-offset">
    <div className="hd-sample__wrapper">
        <div className="myBadge"><span className="hd-sample-off-centered-text fixed">New</span></div>
        <div className="myHeadline"><span className="hd-sample-off-centered-text fixed">Bring out the best in your team</span></div>
    </div>
</div>
