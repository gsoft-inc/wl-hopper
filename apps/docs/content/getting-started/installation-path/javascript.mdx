Hopper is a flexible Design System designed to help you create visually consistent and beautiful applications. While Hopper offers React components for building UI elements, its design tokens and icons are framework-agnostic, making them accessible for use in any project, whether you're using a different framework or plain HTML and CSS.

## What Hopper Offers
- **Design Tokens**: Predefined design decisions such as colors, spacing, and typography, provided as reusable CSS variables for styling your application.
- **Icons**: A comprehensive library of SVG icons, easily accessible through the @hopper-ui/svg-icons package.

This installation procedure provides the steps needed to set up Hopper tokens and icons in non-React projects, enabling you to incorporate these resources directly into your application

## Tokens Installation

### Install Package

Run the following command to install Hopper tokens.

<PackageInstallation library="tokens" mod="prod" />

### Import Styles

Add Hopper styles to your project by importing the following CSS files into your main stylesheet or global CSS file:

```css
@import url("@hopper-ui/tokens/fonts.css"); /* To import Hopper fonts */
@import url("@hopper-ui/tokens/tokens.css"); /* To import the design tokens */
@import url("@hopper-ui/tokens/dark/tokens.css"); /* optional - if your application supports dark mode */
```

If your application supports dark mode, you can include the dark mode token styles for seamless theme switching.

### Enjoy!

You can now use Hopper tokens in your project by referencing the design tokens as CSS variables. For example:

```css
.my-class {
    background-color: var(--hop-primary-surface-weak);
}
```

## Icons Installation

### Install Package
Run the following command to install Hopper SVG icons.

<PackageInstallation library="svg-icons" mod="prod" />

### Usage

You can use Hopper SVG icons in two ways:

#### In JavaScript/TypeScript Files

Import an SVG icon directly into your code. Ensure your bundler (e.g., Webpack, Vite, Rollup) is configured to handle SVG imports correctly.

```tsx
import alertIcon from "@hopper-ui/svg-icons/alert-24.svg";
```

#### In CSS

Use SVG icons directly in your CSS for styles such as background images.

```css
.my-component {
    background-image: url("@hopper-ui/svg-icons/alert-24.svg");
}
```
