Hopper is a Design System that provides a collection of [React components](../../components/component-list), [tokens](../../tokens/overview/introduction), and [icons](../../icons/overview/introduction) to help you build applications.

**Requirements:**
- [React 18](https://reactjs.org/) or higher.

## Installation

### Install Packages

Run the following command to install Hopper packages and their peer dependencies.

<PackageInstallation library="components @hopper-ui/icons @hopper-ui/styled-system react-aria react-aria-components" mod="prod" />

### Setup provider

Wrap your application with the [HopperProvider](/components/HopperProvider) component. This sets up the global styles and context required for Hopper components. Typically, this is done in your `index.tsx` or `app.tsx`, but it may vary depending on your setup.

```tsx {2,6,8}
import { HopperProvider } from "@hopper-ui/components";
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
    <HopperProvider withBodyStyle>
        <App />
    </HopperProvider>
);
```

### Import Styles

Add Hopper styles to your project by importing the following CSS file. Place this in your global CSS file or main stylesheet.

```css
@import url("@hopper-ui/components/index.css");
```

### Enjoy!
Leverage Hopper's components and styled system to build user interfaces efficiently and with ease.

```tsx
import { Button, Stack } from "@hopper-ui/components";

const Demo = () => {
    return (
        <Stack>
            <Button>Click me</Button>
            <Button>Click me</Button>
        </Stack>
    );
}
```
