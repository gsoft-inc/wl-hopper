## Introduction

Lorem ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

### With Title, Caption and line numbers

```js showLineNumbers {3} /levels/ title="index.js" caption="Don't reassign const."
const levels = 3;
const a = 1;
const a = 2;
const a = 4;
```

### Start line numbers at a specific line number

```js showLineNumbers{42}"
const levels = 3;
const weapons = 10;
```

### Inline Code Highlighting

The result of `[1, 2, 3].join('-'){:js}` is `'1-2-3'{:js}`.

### Group highlighted words by id

```js /age/#v /name/#v /setAge/#s /setName/#s /50/#i /'Taylor'/#i
const [age, setAge] = useState(50);
const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');
```

### Highlight plain text

The name of this function is `getStringLength{:.entity.name.function}`.

### Context aware inline-code

```js
function getStringLength(str) {
  return str.length;
}
```

When we refer to `getStringLength{:.entity.name.function}` as a plain variable,
we can color it as a function.
