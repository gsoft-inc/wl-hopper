 * Writing slots in a component can be a bit tricky. This component is a utility that allows you to clear the slots of a component.
 *
 * For instance: In a dialog, slots could apply specific styles to a Divider divider between the heading and the content.
 * If someone wanted to make a two column layout in their content and use a Divider, they'd need to do some work to get rid of the class name the dialog applies.
 *
 * There are a few reasons why you might want to clear slots:
 * - You're trying to make a component that is a container for other components, and you don't want anything set above to affect your content.
 * - You're trying to specify a different slot provider inside
