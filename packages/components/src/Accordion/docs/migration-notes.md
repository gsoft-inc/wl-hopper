Coming from Orbiter, you should be aware of the following changes:

- `expansionMode="multiple"` has been replaced with `allowsMultipleExpanded`. 
- `bordered` and `borderless` variants have been renamed `inline` and `standalone`. There is no direct mapping, the new variants are context based, wether an accordion is contained or not.
