Coming from Orbiter, you should be aware of the following changes:

- `Heading` and `Content` slots are replaced by `Text` with `heading` and `description` slots respectfully. Refer to this [sample](#default) to see an implementation example.
- `orientation` has been removed. Refer to this [sample](#horizontal) to see an implementation example for a horizontal orientation.
- `width` and `height` prop will now affect the whole wrapper instead of just the image.
